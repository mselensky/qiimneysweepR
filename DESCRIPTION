Title: An R-based workflow for processing imported QIIME2 artifacts
Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: This is my workflow for processing QIIME2 output data. I mostly just wanted to organize the various functions I've written.
    This package attempts reshape ASV table data for common microbiome analyses such as NMDS and network visualizations. I have attempted to write the outputs so they are easily plottable with ggplot2.
