# qiimneysweepR

<p> This is my workflow for processing QIIME2 output data. I mostly just wanted to have an easy and organized way to call the various functions I've written for my own purposes. It is still a work-in-progress. However, others are welcome to use qiimneysweepR if they so please! </p>

<p> The functions included in this package reshape the data from collapsed OTU or ASV tables for common microbiome analyses such as NMDS and community network visualizations. I also provide functions to color terminal dendrogram segments based on a defined metadata attribute. I have attempted to format all outputs so they are easily plottable with ggplot2. </p>
